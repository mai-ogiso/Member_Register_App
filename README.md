## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript(vanilla)

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would try to use a database so that the member's information is stored and a user can use or update it.
  
I didn't set media query for mobile appropriately yet, so I would set it.

## Lessons Learned:

1. This was related to my previous project which was called Chinese zodiac app. --> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mai-ogiso/Chinese_Zodiac_App/">Visit Here</a>
2. I learned more about JS while creating this app such as creating or removing elements dynamically and how to iterate status.
3. To display cards with carousel was fun and minimize the screen size.
